# Nvim-Ide
I wrote a simple script that copy and downloads the necessary files to configure your Nvim to an full on Ide .







WHAT ARE YOU GETTING OUT OF THIS BASH SCRIPT ?  




You will get clang,node-js and ripgrep packages downloaded and a Packer Aur install 


LSP CONFIGURATRION?

This is setting up c,c++ environment but if you dont want it after the installion go to 
~/.config/nvim/after/plugin/Lsp.lua

:Mason

and search for desired Lsp 





I highly encourage you to read the keybindings ~/.config/nvim/lua/alt/rempa.lua to get the basic 
keybindings 

You can even Navigate to ~/.config/nvim/after/plugin/Lsp.lua To get LSP keybindings which are at very bottom.

~/.config/nvim/after/plugin/telescop.lua To know the telescope keybindings
